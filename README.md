Module-1 introduces basic Machine Learning concepts, tasks, and workflow using an example classification problem based on the K-nearest neighbors method, and implemented using the scikit-learn library. Module-2 delves into a wider variety of supervised learning methods for both classification and regression.  Module-3 covers evaluation and model selection methods that you can use to help understand and optimize the performance of your machine learning models. Module-4  covers more advanced supervised learning methods that include ensembles of trees (random forests, gradient boosted trees), and neural networks (with an optional summary on deep learning). You will also learn about the critical problem of data leakage in machine learning and how to detect and avoid it.
